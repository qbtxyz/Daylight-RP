# Daylight
Daylight is a role-playing platform for Bohemia Interactive's ArmA 3.

**In it's current state, Daylight RP is unfinished and not under active development. The creators of Daylight RP want to emphasize that Daylight RP works as a platform for future role-playing missions.**

## What still needs to be done
Daylight RP works as a framework for your own projects, what still needs to be done is up to you. However, here are some key functionalities missing from Daylight RP:
* Replace old PVEH's (daylight_fnc_networkExecGlobal, daylight_fnc_networkExecServer, daylight_fnc_networkExecClient, daylight_fnc_networkExecPlayer) that are used in inventory functions. **These outdated PVEH's allow for easy remote code execution.**
* Rethink & code inventory drop/take/give functions.
* Keychain (there are already functions for this, but no UI)
